The arrangement of furniture should clearly delineate behavioral expectations. For children with autism, who often have strengths in visual information processing, establishing well-defined visual boundaries is beneficial. Spaces designated for regaining or maintaining calmness, distinct from areas used for time-outs or task avoidance, should be equipped with items that facilitate relaxation. These areas should allow for ongoing reinforcement and task completion.
"""
    let context2 = """
Activities demanding higher levels of energy and effort should be followed by those requiring less, and a variety of tasks, including those easily completed, should precede more challenging or less preferred ones. Visual aids like daily schedules and work agendas can help delineate the duration and transitions between activities, enhancing predictability and performance. Teaching the commencement and conclusion of activities, possibly with tools like timers and visual signals, supports students' understanding of task boundaries.
"""
    let context3 = """
Allowing students to familiarize themselves with materials and practice activities beforehand can improve predictability and task performance. Employing consistent materials and including easily accomplished tasks during activities can ensure a high level of reinforcement.

    let dtt = """
    DTT involves clear, scripted steps for each phase, allowing educators to discern which methods or strategies to employ. Key considerations include:
    - Managing the teaching environment
    - Understanding the child's skill level
    - Maintaining motivation

    Maximizing student response involves:
    - Designing a focused environment
    - Selecting behaviors from the student's repertoire that facilitate task execution
    The goal is to foster stimulus dependency, responding to given instructions while ignoring others.

    The procedure includes:
    - Focusing attention
    - Presenting stimuli with consistency, clarity, and conciseness
    - Providing prompts for incorrect responses
    - Responding to the child's actions (correct, incorrect, or no response)
    - Providing feedback (reinforcement for correct responses, prompts, and corrective feedback for incorrect or no responses)

    The interval between trials allows for a brief pause before introducing the next discriminative stimulus.

    let prt = """
    PRT is characterized by behavior generalized and maintained through naturally occurring consequences.

    Central behaviors include:
    - Motivation
    - Responding to multiple cues
    - Initiating self-directed responses
    - Self-management

    PRT emphasizes:
    - Student interest
    - Shared control
    - Choice utilization
    - Varied activities and materials
    - The simultaneous use of acquisition and maintenance tasks

    It encourages student attempts and employs immediate and natural reinforcement.
