    Deficits in the Development, Maintenance, and Comprehension of Relationships encompass difficulties in sharing imaginative play and challenges in forging friendships.

    The Theory of Mind pertains to the aptitude for discerning the mental states of oneself and others, inclusive of beliefs, desires, and intentions. This faculty is characterized by components such as belief, desire, and action, and is marked by an impaired capacity to grasp and attend to the emotional expressions of others.

    Social Deficits are typified by a spectrum of indifferent, passive, and non-normative forms and characteristics.
    Executive Functioning encompasses challenges associated with planning, impulse control, sustaining situations, and the flexibility of thoughts and actions.

    The Central Coherence Theory elucidates the challenges encountered in extracting necessary information from intricate data, establishing meaningful connections between information, and the processing of complex information.

    The Theory of Mind (ToM) is a concept that refers to the ability to comprehend the thoughts, emotions, intentions, and beliefs of oneself and others. It is an essential competency for navigating social contexts and adhering to social norms. Within the autism spectrum, the significance of ToM is underscored by the prevalent deficits in this area among individuals with autism.

    Attributes of ToM encompass:

    The capacity to influence personal behavior and interpersonal interactions.
    The ability to anticipate the actions of others.
    A fundamental skill for interpreting social environments and behaving in accordance with social expectations.
    Deficits in ToM, often denoted as "mindblindness," encompass:

    The inability to deduce and understand the perspectives, thoughts, and emotions of others, leading to inappropriate reactions to the emotional states and beliefs of others.
    Difficulties in foreseeing the potential statements or actions of others in varying contexts.
    Challenges in recognizing that peers possess their own distinct thoughts and feelings, potentially resulting in egocentric or isolated conduct.
    The incapacity to comprehend that others may hold thoughts and beliefs divergent from one's own, frequently resulting in complications in social interaction and communication.
    """
    
    
    let communication = """
    Persistent Deficits in Social Communication include failures in normal conversational reciprocity, restricted sharing of emotions, and the inability to initiate or reciprocate social interactions.

    Deficits in Non-verbal Communicative Behaviors entail difficulties in comprehending and utilizing gestures, a lack of eye contact, and a complete absence of facial expressions and non-verbal communication.

    Semantic Language Development is characterized by significantly limited vocabulary comprehension; challenges in acquiring abstract terms, and difficulties in understanding idioms and proverbs.

    Pragmatic Language Development involves challenges in grasping the thoughts or viewpoints of others, failures in conversational exchange, difficulties in maintaining conversation topics, and impediments to initiating spontaneous dialogues.

    Echolalia encompasses explanations for both immediate and delayed echolalia functions.
    """
    
    let echolalia = """
    In the context of autism spectrum disorders, echolalia refers to the repetition of the speech of others, which may occur immediately after the speech is heard (immediate echolalia) or after a delay (delayed echolalia). This repetition can serve various communicative functions, despite potential limitations in expressive language abilities.

    Immediate echolalia involves the replication of words or phrases immediately following their auditory reception. It may act as evidence of comprehension and serve a functional role, indicating that the individual has understood the spoken language at a receptive level.

    Delayed echolalia involves the repetition of previously heard words or phrases after a temporal delay. This form of echolalia can facilitate interaction in diverse manners. If the intended message behind the echoed speech is understood and appropriately responded to by others, it demonstrates the communicative competence of the individual, irrespective of the modality employed. Thus, delayed echolalia contributes to functional communication by enabling the individual to engage in exchanges, even if the original utterances were not self-generated.

    Restricted and Repetitive Patterns of Behavior, Interests, or Activities are characterized by stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, utilization of objects, or speech.

    Insistence on Sameness involves rigid cognitive patterns, inflexible adherence to routines, and ritualized patterns of verbal or non-verbal behavior.

    Highly Restricted, Fixated Interests are marked by an intense attachment to atypical objects and excessively circumscribed or perseverative interests.

    Hyper- or Hypo-reactivity to Sensory Input is evident in an apparent indifference to pain/temperature, excessive smelling or touching of objects, and a visual fascination with lights or movement.
    """
    
    let stereotypy = """
    Stereotypy, or stereotypical behavior, denotes repetitive, non-functional motor movements or gestures commonly observed in individuals with developmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These behaviors, which may include hand-flapping, rocking, spinning objects, or repetitive vocalizations, are characterized by:

    A lack of overt functional impact on the surrounding environment: Stereotypical behaviors typically do not serve an immediate or discernible purpose within the individual's context.
    A self-stimulatory essence: Many stereotypical behaviors are posited to provide sensory feedback or internal gratification, which may be perceived as soothing or pleasurable by the individual engaging in the behavior.
    Persistence and resistance to interruption: Stereotypical behaviors can exhibit a high degree of persistence and may resist efforts at interruption or redirection.
    Variability in intensity and frequency: The intensity and occurrence of stereotypical behaviors can fluctuate based on the individual's environment, levels of stress, and overall arousal state.
